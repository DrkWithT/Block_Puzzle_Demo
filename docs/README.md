### Description:
This is a simple prototype of a block dragging game where one clears a way to the red "goal" block. It's basically inspired by the **Unblock Me** mobile game. In addition, this was speed written within a night or two, so I did not have time to really flesh this one out.

For the Git repo history, I forgot to use it from the start until I finished writing the initial buggy code. This is why the 1st commit is really large! The rest of the code history contains my hasty fixes.
