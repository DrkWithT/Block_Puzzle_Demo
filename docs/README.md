### Description:
This is a simple prototype of a block dragging game where one clears a way to the red "goal" block. It's basically inspired by the **Unblock Me** mobile game. In addition, this was speed written within a night or two, so I did not have time to really flesh this one out.

For the Git repo history, I forgot to use it from the start until I finished writing the initial buggy code. This is why the 1st commit is really large! The rest of the code history contains my hasty fixes.

### Extra Info:
 - This project was created on a Windows machine. Thus, the line endings might be wrong for UNIX-style systems, despite my tries in setting up auto fixes for line endings by git on any system.
 - Only two levels are available for now. You can modify or extend this code, but I would like to be credited as the original programmer. :)
 - This was made with Firefox as a testing browser. As long as the browser supports HTML5 canvas and ES6 classes, it will function fine.
